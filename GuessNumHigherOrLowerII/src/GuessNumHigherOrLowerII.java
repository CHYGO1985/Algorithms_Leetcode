/**
 * 
 * 375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II
 * 
 * round 1: unsolved, 
 * 
 * ref: https://discuss.leetcode.com/topic/51353/simple-dp-solution-with-explanation/2
 * 
 * Idea: I was trying to find regulations to form a dp formula, but did not success. And I stick on it. I draw from 1 to 18 to reserve the
 * results, tried to find certain regulation.
 * However it turns out that it is a dp solution that save the intermediate status, not a traditional dp that goes iterately and then reach
 * to an answer. 
 * 
 * the solution of this question is based on the formula that from i to j, when pick k between i and j, the max val is
 * k + Math.max(findMax(i, k - 1), findMax(k + 1, j)) (max means the worst case), and the cost that guarantee a win is a min(means the best strategy) 
 * among all the k vals between i and j.
