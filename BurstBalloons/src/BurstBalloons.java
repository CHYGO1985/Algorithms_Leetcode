/**
 * 312. Burst Balloons
 * 
 * round 1: unsolved, 3 hours
 * I first try to find a formula, then found it is impossible. then I switch to
 * top-down recursive or bottom up DP. For top down, i think about divide the 
 * process by the first ele that is chosen, however, the first ele is related
 * to the left and right adjacent ele of the two potential divided parts ...
 * that is what I stuck. however, according to authers in the ref: 
 * 
 * "Well, the nature way to divide the problem is burst one balloon and 
 * separate the balloons into 2 sub sections one on the left and one one the 
 * right. However, in this problem the left and right become adjacent and have
 * effects on the maxCoins in the future."
 * 
 * " Then another interesting idea come up. Which is quite often seen in dp 
 * problem analysis. That is reverse thinking. Like I said the coins you get 
 * for a balloon does not depend on the balloons already burst. Therefore"  
 * 
 * So *** if i tried reversed thinking here, i should get the answer by now.
 * 
 * e.g. 3 5 8
 * 1) extend to 1 3 5 8 1
 * 2) if 8 is the last
 * 8 + 1 3 5 8 + 8 1 
 * (8 1 will be ignored as the last ele always begin with start + 1ï¼Œ
 * as the array now are all considered as extended)
 * 3) 1 3 5 8 if 3 is the last
 * 1*3*8 + 1 3 + 3 5 8
 * 4) 3 5 8
 * 3*5*8 + 3 5 + 5 8
 * 
 * it seems like a save intermediate status DP, not a formula DP.
 * 
 * Try to find the intermediate status of recursive process.
 * 
 * 1) top-down: recursive method
 * 2) bottom up: dp
